### 类型分类

Basic Types - what we’ll be covering in this tutorial
Aggregate Types - These are arrays and structs
Reference Types - These are your pointers and slices
Interface Types - These are your standard interfaces

~~~ GO
// all numeric types default to 0

// unsigned int with 8 bits
// Can store: 0 to 255
var myint uint8
// signed int with 8 bits
// Can store: -127 to 127
var myint int8

// unsigned int with 16 bits
var myint uint16
// signed int with 16 bits
var myint int16

// unsigned int with 32 bits
var myint uint32
// signed int with 32 bits
var myint int32

// unsigned int with 64 bits
var myint uint64
// signed int with 64 bits
var myint int64
